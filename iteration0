Experiment 1: Calculation (Design Validation)

Method: Calculate thrust-to-weight ratio using motor specs and component weights

Weight Budget:
 Motor:           26g
 Propeller:        3g
 ESC:              9g
 Battery:         40g
 Adapter:          2g
 Frame/mount:     20g (estimated)
 Wiring/misc:      5g (estimated)
 -------------------------
 Total weight:   ~105g

Thrust Calculation:
 Motor spec: 2204 2300KV with 5" prop @ 3S = ~400-440g thrust at full throttle
 Using conservative estimate: 400g thrust

Thrust-to-Weight Ratio:
 Ratio = 400g / 105g = 3.81:1

Result: YES - Should lift off easily
 - Ratio > 2:1 is considered good for multirotors
 - Ratio > 3:1 is excellent
 - 3.81:1 means significant lifting capability with throttle headroom

Expected Performance:
 - Theoretical hover throttle: ~26% (105g / 400g)
 - With inefficiencies: ~35-40% throttle to hover
 - Should lift off surface at ~50-60% throttle
 - Full throttle would produce strong upward force

Next Step: Physical test to validate calculation
